\title{Lopez VCA}
\usage{
vcaLopez(data, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data to unmix. It will be converted to a matrix using
as.matrix. The matrix should contain a spectrum per row.}

\item{p}{Number of endmembers}
}
\value{
Endmember indices
}
\description{
The original VCA algorithm (\code{\link{vca}}) contains auxiliary
operations (signal to noise estimation, etc.) which could be omitted while
still maintaining a fully functional algorithm. In paper that describes
the Modified VCA algorithm (\code{\link{vcaMod}}) the author provides a
description of the original VCA with only the essential components
included. This is an implementation of that algorithm
