\usage{
nfindrBrute(data, p, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data matrix to unmix}

\item{p}{Number of endmembers}

\item{...}{Extra unused parameters that get passed in from
\code{\link{nfindr}}}
}
\value{
The indices that indicate the position of the endmembers in the
  original dataset
}
\description{
This method exhaustively checks every possible simplex that could be
formed from p points and returns the indices that generated the simplex
with the largest volume. This should indicate the endmembers based on the
theory of N-FINDR. It should only be used for testing purposes as an
exhaustive verification of the results from other N-FINDR methods as it
is extremely slow for non-trivial datasets.
