NEWS file for package unmixR

unmixR implements the N-FINDR and Vertex Component Analysis (VCA) algorithms which can recover pure component spectra and their respective concentrations from a hyperspectral data set.

unmixR was originally authored by Conor McManus during the Google Summer of Code 2013.  Conor was supervised by Simon Fuller, Claudia Beleites and Bryan Hanson.  Claudia now maintains the package.  See citation("unmixR").

##### Version 0.1-2
Date: 2014-05-29
>> Now builds and checks WITH the unit tests, except that one of the vca.formula tests was behaving badly and was commented out, AND, all tests involving .testdata are commented out, which is related to the next item, still a work in progress.
>> Corrected what I think were some errors in estSNR (see notes within the file).  Also set some traps to monitor the SNR.  With .testdata, which is noiseless(?), one can get some pretty odd answers.  Not sure if this is the final solution to this problem.
>> Modified .testdata in unittests.R so that the column names were consistent (a cosmetic fix).
>> Still needs extensive testing.

##### Version 0.1-1
Date: 2014-05-28
>> Fixed collate order so that the svUnit framework is fully visible.  Tests still fail.
>> Still needs extensive testing.

##### Version 0.1-0
Date: 2014-05-26
>> Builds and checks when skipping vignettes and unit tests.
>> Still needs extensive testing.
