NEWS file for package unmixR

unmixR implements the N-FINDR and Vertex Component Analysis (VCA) algorithms which can recover pure component spectra and their respective concentrations from a hyperspectral data set.

unmixR was originally authored by Conor McManus during the Google Summer of Code 2013.  Conor was supervised by Simon Fuller, Claudia Beleites and Bryan Hanson.  Claudia now maintains the package.  See citation("unmixR").

##### Version 0.1-6
Date: 2014-06-09
>> Added functions spectraDist and abundanceImage.  Testing shows these give good results with the MUD_A data set.

##### Version 0.1-5
Date: 2014-06-05
>> Changed roxygen2 settings for predict, nfindr.default, nfindr.formula, vca.formula & vca.default.  It is no longer necessary for S3 methods to be declared but you must export the methods.  All you need to write is simply use @export, roxygen2 seems to figure it all out.
>> Changes made yesterday to .simplex were probably not necessary but do no harm.  Had forgotten that nfindr.default was doing the pca before .simplex was called.
>> Found an error in nfindrBrute where the data was not being transposed.  See note in file.  Runs now.
 
##### Version 0.1-4
Date: 2014-06-04
>> Made sure all vca and nfindr functions sorted their indices before returning them.
>> Restored nfindrLDU.R which had been deleted at some point.
>> Made sure the documentation was consistent regarding the indices.  
>> NOTE: See the documentation for the return value of vca05.  I may have broken something when I made the 2nd change listed for version 0.1-3.

##### Version 0.1-3
Date: 2014-06-04
>> Now exports most everything, even if only for troubleshooting convenience.
>> Modified vca05 so it returns only the indices, which is consistent with what all other vca and nfindr functions do.  Fixed the class definition in vca.default accordingly.

##### Version 0.1-2
Date: 2014-05-29
>> Now builds and checks WITH the unit tests, except that one of the vca.formula tests was behaving badly and was commented out, AND, all tests involving .testdata are commented out, which is related to the next item, still a work in progress.
>> Corrected what I think were some errors in estSNR (see notes within the file).  Also set some traps to monitor the SNR.  With .testdata, which is noiseless(?), one can get some pretty odd answers.  Not sure if this is the final solution to this problem.
>> Modified .testdata in unittests.R so that the column names were consistent (a cosmetic fix).
>> Still needs extensive testing.

##### Version 0.1-1
Date: 2014-05-28
>> Fixed collate order so that the svUnit framework is fully visible.  Tests still fail.
>> Still needs extensive testing.

##### Version 0.1-0
Date: 2014-05-26
>> Builds and checks when skipping vignettes and unit tests.
>> Still needs extensive testing.
